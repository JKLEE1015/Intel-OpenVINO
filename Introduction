Introduction
In this blog, you will learn how to perform inference on JPEG images using the gRPC API in OpenVINO Model Server. 
Model servers play an important role in smoothly bringing models from development to production. 
They serve models via network endpoints and expose APIs for interacting with them. 
Once a model is served, a set of functions are required to call the API from our application.
OpenVINOâ„¢ Model Server and TensorFlow Serving share the same frontend API, meaning we can use the same code to interact with both. 
For Python developers, the typical starting point is using the tensorflow-serving-api pip package. 
Unfortunately, since this package includes TensorFlow as a dependency, its footprint is quite large.
